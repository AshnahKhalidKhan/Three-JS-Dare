# Three-JS-Dare
A tiny project to make the smallest Three.js project ever and how to deploy it.

- First things first, three.js is a **3D JavaScript library** that enables developers to create 3D experiences for the web - remember this for interviews.
- Three.js works best with WebGL, but also works in a limited way with SVG and CSS. (What is WebGL? Bus sochtay raho ab :P)
- So, main concept is that WebGL is a **JavaScript API** and - full disclosure - this is what I got from ChatGPT: _WebGL is a JavaScript API so it gives access to properties and methods and objects for working directly with the GPU. Three.js is a JavaScript library, so it gives access to higher-level constructs like scenes, cameras, lights, geometries, materials, and helpers that simplify building 3D graphics without handling raw WebGL details._
- The main idea of WebGL is to draw triangles at a very remarkable speed in an HTML `<canvas>` element, using a GPU.
- Mr. doob (lol) created three.js.
